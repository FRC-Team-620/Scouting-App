The goal of this project is to create a web application similar to The Blue Alliance. It will display match schedules, team information, and event details for robotics competitions. The application will be built using modern web technologies and will be designed to be user-friendly and responsive. The project will have the unique feature of allowing users to add scouting data for teams, which will be stored in a database and displayed on the team pages. The application will also include a search function to easily find teams and events. Overall, the goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible platform for robotics enthusiasts to stay informed about competitions and teams. The project will be developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, including React for the user interface, Node.js for the server-side logic, and Firestore for the database. The development process will follow best practices for software development, including version control with Git, code reviews, and testing. The final product will be a polished and professional web application that meets the needs of the robotics community. The project will use the black and red color theme of frc team 620, the Warbots.
